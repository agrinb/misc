### Moat code challenge

using python 2.7.5

Please find submissions for challenge #3 (nested_hash directory) and #7 (hash_class directory) in their respective folders

 - Please note in the Hash class (Hash_me) 10 slots were be chosen for the sake of this execise to increase chances of collisions and therefore handle them properly and to conserve memory.


 - I focussed on the functionality of the Class rather than syntax, and therfore did not create hash literal notation.
